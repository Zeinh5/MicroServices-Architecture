Create a microservices-based e-commerce platform using Spring Boot. The platform should support user management, product catalog, order processing, and payment handling.
Requirements:
1.	Project Setup:
•	Set up a multi-module Maven project with separate modules for each microservice.
•	Include dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Cloud Netflix (Eureka, Ribbon, Feign), Spring Cloud Config, Spring Boot DevTools, MySQL/PostgreSQL.
2.	Microservices:
•	User Service:
•	Fields: id (Long), username (String), password (String), email (String), roles (List<String>).
•	Endpoints:
•	POST /users - Register a new user.
•	POST /login - Authenticate a user.
•	GET /users/{id} - Get user details.
•	Product Service:
•	Fields: id (Long), name (String), description (String), price (Double), stock (Integer), category (String).
•	Endpoints:
•	GET /products - Get all products.
•	GET /products/{id} - Get product by ID.
•	POST /products - Add a new product.
•	PUT /products/{id} - Update a product.
•	DELETE /products/{id} - Delete a product.
•	Order Service:
•	Fields: id (Long), userId (Long), productIds (List<Long>), totalAmount (Double), orderStatus (String), orderDate (LocalDateTime).
•	Endpoints:
•	POST /orders - Create a new order.
•	GET /orders/{id} - Get order details.
•	GET /orders/user/{userId} - Get orders by user ID.
•	Payment Service:
•	Fields: id (Long), orderId (Long), paymentStatus (String), paymentDate (LocalDateTime), paymentMethod (String).
•	Endpoints:
•	POST /payments - Process a payment.
•	GET /payments/{orderId} - Get payment details by order ID.
3.	Service Discovery and Configuration:
•	Implement Eureka Server for service discovery.
•	Register all microservices with Eureka Server.
•	Use Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration management.
4.	API Gateway:
•	Implement an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul.
•	Route requests to appropriate microservices.
•	Implement basic rate limiting and request logging.
5.	Security:
•	Implement OAuth2 or JWT for securing microservices.
•	Ensure endpoints are protected and roles-based access control is enforced.
6.	Database Configuration:
•	Use MySQL or PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
•	Each microservice should have its own database.
•	Configure application properties for database connections.
7.	Inter-Service Communication:
•	Use Rest clients for communication between microservices.
•	Implement Circuit Breaker pattern using Hystrix or Resilience4j.
8.	Testing:
•	Write unit tests and integration tests for all microservices.
•	Use JUnit, Mockito, and Spring Boot Test.
9.	Containerization and Deployment:
•	Dockerize each microservice.
•	Create a Docker Compose file for local development.
•	Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) using Kubernetes.
10.	Documentation:
•	Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.
•	Ensure all endpoints are documented and can be tested via the Swagger UI.
•	Provide a detailed README file with setup and deployment instructions.
Deliverables:
•	Source code repository (e.g., GitHub) with the completed project.
•	README file with project setup instructions and any relevant information.
•	Swagger UI URL for API testing.
•	Docker Compose file and Kubernetes deployment scripts.
•	ELK stack and Prometheus/Grafana setup instructions.
